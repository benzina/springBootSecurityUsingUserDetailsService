# springBootSecurityUsingUserDetailsService
Example of implement UserDetailsService Security in application

To illustrate the implementation of UserDetailsService, letâ€™s assume an internal portal of a small company.
In company we have various roles within employees such as Admin, HR, Manager and of course Employee as well.
Additionally, the Portal has role based access to pages.
Even Some pages are accessible to all roles while others are restricted to some particular roles.
Equally important, the company will have a user registration page which must be accessible to all users, even without login.
